Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

# Conceptual Example:
This example illustrates the structure of the Abstract Factory design pattern. It focuses on answering these questions:
* What classes does it consist of?
* What roles do these classes play?
* In what way the elements of the pattern are related?

After learning about the pattern’s structure it’ll be easier for you to grasp the following example, based on a real-world PHP, Go, Js and Java use case.

# Real World Example:
## AccesCSV
This example of the Iterator pattern provides easy access to CSV files.

## Book and User Iterator
In both examples, we define an iterator that allows the client to traverse through collections (books or users) while keeping the collection encapsulated and providing an easy interface for iteration.
