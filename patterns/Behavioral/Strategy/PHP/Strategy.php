| Strategy Design Pattern - Sorting Algorithm Example
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This example demonstrates the Strategy Design Pattern, where the algorithm 
| for sorting is defined in separate strategy classes. The context object 
| delegates the sorting task to the current strategy, allowing it to 
| switch between algorithms at runtime.

|
| Key Components:
| 1. **Context**: Defines the interface for interacting with different strategies 
|    and delegates the business logic to the strategy object.
| 2. **Strategy Interface**: Declares a method for performing the algorithm, 
|    ensuring consistency across different strategy classes.
| 3. **Concrete Strategies**: Provide specific implementations of the algorithm 
|    (e.g., sorting in ascending or descending order).
|
| Use Case:
| Use the Strategy pattern when you need to select an algorithm at runtime, 
| enabling flexibility in changing algorithms without modifying the context 
| or other strategies.
