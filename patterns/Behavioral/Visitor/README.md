Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that allows adding new behaviors to existing class hierarchy without altering any existing code.


# RealWorldExample
## VistorInfra
In this example, the Visitor pattern helps to introduce a reporting feature into an existing class hierarchy: Company > Department > Employee

Once the Visitor infrastructure is added to the app, you can easily add other similar behaviors to the app, without changing the existing classes.
