| Decorator Design Pattern - Implementation Example
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This example demonstrates the Decorator Design Pattern, which allows 
| behavior to be added to an individual object, without affecting the 
| behavior of other objects from the same class.

|
| Key Components:
| 1. **Component Interface**: Defines the common interface for both simple 
|    components and decorators, ensuring that they can be used interchangeably.
|
| 2. **ConcreteComponent**: Implements the `Component` interface and provides 
|    the default behavior for the operation.
|
| 3. **Decorator Class**: Implements the `Component` interface and wraps a 
|    `Component` object. It delegates the work to the wrapped component while 
|    allowing additional behavior to be added.
|
| 4. **ConcreteDecorators**: Extend the `Decorator` class and add additional 
|    functionality or modify the behavior of the wrapped component.
|
| 5. **Client Code**: Interacts with the `Component` interface, allowing 
|    the client to work with simple components or decorated components without 
|    being aware of the specific implementation.
|
| Benefits:
| - **Extensibility**: New functionality can be added to an object without 
|   changing its class.
| - **Flexibility**: Multiple decorators can be combined to compose new behaviors.
| - **Separation of Concerns**: The decoration logic is isolated in separate 
|   decorator classes, keeping the original component simple and focused.
