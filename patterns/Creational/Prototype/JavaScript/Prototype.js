| Prototype Design Pattern - Implementation Example
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This example demonstrates the Prototype Design Pattern, which allows 
| copying objects without depending on their classes, instead relying on a 
| cloning interface.

|
| Key Components:
| 1. **Prototype Class**: Implements the `clone` method for deep cloning.
| 2. **ComponentWithBackReference**: Demonstrates cloning complex objects with
|    back references to the original Prototype instance.
| 3. **Client Code**: Shows how cloning works and validates deep vs shallow 
|    copies.
|
| Use Case:
| Use the Prototype pattern when object creation is expensive or when an 
| object’s state is complex and you'd like to avoid recomputing or reconstructing it.
