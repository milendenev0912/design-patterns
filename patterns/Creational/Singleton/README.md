Singleton is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides a single point of access to it for any other code.

# Conceptual Example:
This example illustrates the structure of the Singleton design pattern and focuses on the following questions:
* What classes does it consist of?
* What roles do these classes play?
* In what way the elements of the pattern are related?

After learning about the pattern’s structure it’ll be easier for you to grasp the following example, based on a real-world PHP use case.

# Real World Example:
## Global Logging:
The Singleton pattern is notorious for limiting code reuse and complicating unit testing. However, it’s still very useful in some cases. In particular, it’s handy when you need to control some shared resources. For example, a global logging object that has to control the access to a log file. Another good example: a shared runtime configuration storage.

## Database Connection
This example creates a singleton for managing a database connection, ensuring only one instance is used throughout the application.
DatabaseConnection: Manages a single database connection instance.

## Application Settings
This example demonstrates a singleton for application settings, allowing global access to configuration values.
AppSettings: Manages global application settings, ensuring consistent access across the application.

## Cache Manager Singleton
This example implements a singleton for managing a cache, ensuring a single instance handles cache storage.
CacheManager: Handles caching of data, providing a single point of access to cache resources.

These examples illustrate how the Singleton pattern can be applied to various scenarios where a single instance of a class is beneficial.
