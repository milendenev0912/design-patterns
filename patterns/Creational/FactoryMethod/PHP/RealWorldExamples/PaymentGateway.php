| Factory Method Design Pattern - Payment Gateway Example
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This example demonstrates the Factory Method Design Pattern used to handle
| various types of payment gateway processors, such as PayPal and Stripe. 
| The design encapsulates object creation to allow flexible extension of 
| payment gateways without altering client code.

|
| Key Components:
| 1. PaymentProcessor (Abstract Class): Declares the factory method that must 
|    return objects implementing PaymentGatewayConnector. It may include common
|    payment processing logic.
| 2. Concrete Payment Processors: Implement the factory method to create specific
|    payment gateway connectors (e.g., PayPalConnector, StripeConnector).
| 3. PaymentGatewayConnector (Interface): Defines the contract for all payment 
|    gateway connectors, ensuring consistent behavior such as `connect`, `pay`, 
|    and `disconnect`.
| 4. Concrete Payment Gateway Connectors: Provide concrete implementations of 
|    the PaymentGatewayConnector interface for specific gateways.
| 5. Client Code: Works with PaymentProcessor and PaymentGatewayConnector via 
|    their abstract interfaces, enabling flexibility and adherence to the 
|    open/closed principle.
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Use Case:
| Use the Factory Method pattern when a class needs to create objects but wants 
| to defer the instantiation logic to its subclasses, allowing for flexible 
| extension and easier maintenance.
